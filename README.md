# PointsOfInterest
A Spigot 1.9/Bukkit 1.9 plugin based on this project http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/pointsofinterests/

The only change is that it works with spigot/bukkit 1.9

## Where can I get the .jar?

Download it from the following link: http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=30643263176710794644

Or create a .jar from src in the usual mannor (ask a question if you don't know what that means!)

## Contributions

Feel free to fork or contribute code to this branch. I don't have a plugin registered to BukkitDEV myself but, I'm willing to support development if there is any interest at all.
